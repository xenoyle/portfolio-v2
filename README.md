## 📌 Purpose

This website serves as a digital portfolio to:
- Introduce myself and my mindset
- Showcase my work experience, technical projects, and skillset
- Demonstrate familiarity with modern web technologies and UI/UX principles
- Provide a way to get in touch with me directly

It also includes a preserved legacy version of my first personal website under the `/old` route.
